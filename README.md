With the 2 days learning of React.
What I gained is:

1. JSX
2. Components and Props
3. State and Lifecycle
4. Handling Events
5. Forms or Controlled Components
6. useState hook
7. flux pattern
8. React routes
9. bootstrap-react


For the time being, this code is modified to following the flux pattern yet.
