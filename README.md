This project used Amazon Cognito for the user authorization. Customed the react-routes to keep the login session. bootstrap-react for the css.
When test the login function please use: test1:hjxHlk@123. After login success, it will replace the login with logout.

With the 2 days learning of React.
What I gained is:


1. JSX
2. Components and Props
3. State and Lifecycle
4. Handling Events
5. Forms or Controlled Components
6. useState hook
7. flux pattern (used in official example of "todo" project)
8. React routes
9. bootstrap-react


For the time being, this code is modified to following the flux pattern yet.
